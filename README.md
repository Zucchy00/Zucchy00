# Who am I
Hello everyone👋🏼!<br/>
My name is Daniele. I'm from Italy🟢⚪🔴 and I studied IT at ITIS Pietro Paleocapa in Bergamo (berghèm).<br/>
I'm interested in computer science, robotics and 3D printing!

### How I started
My journey with software began in the third year of high school when I first learnt about C programming language.
So gradually I increased my skills starting from the basics of C to using pointers with structs.
After a while, I started enjoying learning other programming languages as python🐍 and :yellow_circle:Javascript.<br/>
I got into more the world of websites by starting learning :orange_circle:Svelte and Sveltekit, with it i started my journey of full-stack developing :window:web apps and :globe_with_meridians:websites.
<br/>
### Contests
Introducing myself to the world of Linux🐧and raspberry pi by creating this :robot:[Mecanum robot with Sveltekit interface](https://github.com/Zucchy00/MecanumPi) which placed me second 🏆 in the contest called [Hackergen](https://projects.hackersgen.com/2024) in the 2024 edition.
<br/>
### At present
Now I'm working at ABB SACE in Bergamo as an external consultant and looking forward to starting at the University of Bergamo as an IT engineering student.
<br/>
<br/>
Created my first npm package!<br/>
[Github](https://github.com/Zucchy00/svelte-vnc) [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-vnc)
<br/>
### Future
I want to improve my low-level programming skills for microcontrollers like Arduino and ESP32 to become independent in what I want to do one day.
<br/>
<br/>
Happy journey, everyone!
